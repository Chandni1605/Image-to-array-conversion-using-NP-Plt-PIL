## Project Title: Image-to-Array Conversion Using NumPy, Matplotlib, and PIL

### Project Description:

This project focuses on the conversion of images into numerical arrays using Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and PIL . The objective is to demonstrate how to manipulate and analyze image data by transforming it into a format suitable for various computational and data analysis tasks.
This project can serve as a foundational exercise for more advanced image processing and computer vision tasks.
It provides a practical introduction to handling image data in Python, which is useful for fields such as data science, machine learning, and digital art.
